+dnl Automake 1.8 to 1.9.6 used to define mkdir_p.  We now use MKDIR_P,
+dnl while keeping a definition of mkdir_p for backward compatibility.
+dnl @MKDIR_P@ is magic: AC_OUTPUT adjusts its value for each Makefile.
+dnl However we cannot define mkdir_p as $(MKDIR_P) for the sake of
+dnl Makefile.ins that do not define MKDIR_P, so we do our own
+dnl adjustment using top_builddir (which is defined more often than
+dnl MKDIR_P).
